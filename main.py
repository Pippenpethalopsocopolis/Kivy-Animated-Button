#You can just copy and pasta this to quickly make an animated button upon click.
#Firstly button does in_out_bounce animation within kivy and then it's size grows to give it a good look and then,
#It goes to original size.
#Before copying this python stuff, remember to actually creat AnimatedRaisedButton named button in kv file.
