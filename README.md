# Kivy-Animated-Button
Ready to use animated button.

You can just copy and paste this to quickly make an animated button upon click.
Firstly button does in_out_bounce animation within kivy and then it's size grows to give it a good look and then, it goes to original size.
Before copying this python stuff, remember to actually creat AnimatedRaisedButton named button in kv file.
